# 🧭 Spend Analyzer Enhancement Roadmap (Cursor IDE)

This document outlines the structured process to refine the **Fintech Credit Card Spend Analyzer MVP** while maintaining full control, reversibility, and version integrity.

---

## 1. 🔐 Backup & Version Control Setup

**Goal:** Create a clean, restorable environment before enhancements.

### Steps:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Starkknet/spend-analyzer.git
cd spend-analyzer
git checkout -b enhancement-plan
git branch mvp-backup
git push origin mvp-backup
```
- Ensure `.gitignore` excludes `.env`, cache, and temporary data files.
- Use Cursor’s Git timeline to visualize commits and revert points.

## 2. 🎯 Feature Prioritization

| Category | Proposed Additions | Possible Removals | Priority | Reason |
|-----------|-------------------|-------------------|-----------|--------|
| Dashboard UX | Dark mode toggle, smoother chart transitions | – | ⭐ High | Improves usability |
| Insights | AI-powered anomaly detection | – | ⭐⭐ Medium | Adds intelligent insights |
| Reports | Export in PDF and Excel | Redundant CSV button | ⭐⭐ Medium | Cleaner output |
| Alerts | Custom budget thresholds | Hardcoded 30% limit | ⭐⭐⭐ High | User control |
| Data | Upload API for integration with banks | – | ⭐ Low | Post-MVP scalability |

**Action:** Document all changes in `FEATURE_PLAN.md`.

---

## 3. 🔁 Incremental Updates (Branch-Based Development)

**Goal:** Avoid unintended side effects by isolating updates.

### Commands:
```bash
git checkout -b feature/custom-thresholds
# Implement feature, test locally
git add .
git commit -m "Added custom budget threshold feature"
git push origin feature/custom-thresholds
```
Open a **Pull Request** from Cursor to `main` for review.

**Suggested Branch Names:**
- `feature/pdf-export`
- `feature/ai-insights`
- `feature/ui-refresh`

---

## 4. 🧪 Change Management & Validation

**Goal:** Ensure every update is safe and validated.

### Testing Workflow:
- Add `tests/` folder for lightweight unit checks.
- Use Cursor Live Preview for UI verification.
- Maintain a `CHANGELOG.md` for every merged feature.

**Pre-Merge Checklist:**
- ✅ All tests pass locally  
- ✅ UI renders properly  
- ✅ Budget logic verified  
- ✅ Documentation updated

---

## 5. 🔄 Reversion & Rollback Strategy

**Goal:** Guarantee quick recovery from faulty updates.

### Commands:
```bash
git tag v1.0-mvp
git push origin v1.0-mvp
# To revert
git checkout v1.0-mvp
# Or revert a specific commit
git revert <commit-hash>
```
Maintain a `rollback-log.md` file with:
- Issue summary  
- Steps taken  
- Fix date  

---

## 6. 🗓️ Continuous Refinement Schedule

| Day | Action |
|-----|--------|
| Monday | Pick one feature from `FEATURE_PLAN.md` |
| Tuesday | Implement on feature branch |
| Wednesday | Test + Fix bugs |
| Thursday | Review + Merge PR |
| Friday | Update docs + Tag release |

---

## ✅ Final Notes

Following this roadmap ensures:
- Stable MVP integrity
- Incremental and reversible enhancements
